    "Result": " This image is a composite of two photos, with one picture showing a group of people walking across what appears to be a desert landscape at sunset, and the other depicting an edited screenshot from a television program or movie. The edited portion includes visual effects that superimpose additional content onto the original picture, creating a montage-like effect with layered images. "
